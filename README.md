Visualized IIHF Ranking extrapolation to the origins of international ice hockey.

Data consist of:
- separately held European Championships  - 1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1921-1927, 1929, 1932
- World Championships - 1930-2023 except olympic years (1932, 1936, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984 and 1988)
and war pause 1940-1946
- Olympic Games - 1920 Summer, 1924-2022 Winter

Origin of data is mainly English Wikipedia with Czech and German Wikipedia filling incomplete information.

Teams placement notes:
- 1997 World Championship contains three teams which competed in an unofficial "E group" tournament
- 2020 and 2021 World Championship contains placements as used for IIHF ranking that year - mostly based on seedings,
not on tournament results

The ranking formula uses last four years during which an official Olympic Games or a championship was held and uses
up to one Olympic Games and up to four championships.
Events are grouped into superevents - group of events of the same year constituting a common final order of participants.
A Championship held a calendar year before Olympic Games is considered to be within the same year because (usually)
Olympic Games take place several months earlier than a Championship that year.

From year 2000 onwards, points used are the official points by IIHF rankings.

Points assigned to each participant for a superevent prior to year 2000 are defined this way:
- last placed participant gets 20 points
- each better placements gets 20 points more, except for 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th placed participants, which get 40 points
more than the previous participant
