Teams placement notes:
- 1997 World Championship contains three teams which competed in an unofficial "E group" tournament
- 2020 and 2021 World Championship contains placements as used for IIHF ranking that year - mostly based on seedings,
not on tournament results

The ranking formula uses last four years during which an official Olympic Games or a championship was held and uses
up to one Olympic Games and up to four championships.
Events are grouped into superevents - group of events of the same year constituting a common final order of participants.
A Championship held a calendar year before Olympic Games is considered to be within the same year because (usually)
Olympic Games take place several months earlier than a Championship that year.

From year 2000 onwards, points used are the official points by IIHF rankings.

Points assigned to each participant for a superevent prior to year 2000 are defined this way:
- last placed participant gets 20 points
- each better placements gets 20 points more, except for 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th placed participants, which get 40 points
more than the previous participant
